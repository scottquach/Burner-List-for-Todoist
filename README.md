# Burner List for Todoist
Use the day-to-day prioritization of a Burner List backed by the bigger picture organization of Todoist

### How it works

No personal information is stored, Burner List for Todoist utilizes the Todoist api to manipulate the labels associated to tasks. These labels are how tasks are tracked about which burner list a task is placed into. This means that this is simply a UI built on the existing Todoist backend.

The lables used are as follows
* Misc_Burner
* Back_Burner
* Front_Burner
